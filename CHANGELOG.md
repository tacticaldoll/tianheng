# Changelog

All notable changes to the 天衡 (Tianheng) crate family. This is the **adopter-facing**
projection of the release history; the per-change *why* lives in the squashed change commits and
their pull requests. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versioning is **SemVer honesty** for a pre-1.0 line (see `AGENTS.md`): the family is
**experimental / late-stage pre-stability**, held at `0.1.x` deliberately until real adoption
pressure settles which public faces become long-term contracts. Within `0.1.x`, additive depth on
an existing observation source and packaging/hygiene are patch releases, and no release
intentionally breaks the adopter-written builder (`Constitution` / boundary DSL / `run`).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.9] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- 圭表 `must_not_call_inline(…).strict_external()` — **opt-in**: also catch a *fully-qualified
  external-crate* call (e.g. a bare `chrono::Utc::now()` with no `use chrono`), closing the
  asymmetry where a sysroot head (`std::time::…`) was caught but a fully-qualified external head was
  silently resolved as local. A bare head matching a declared dependency is resolved as that crate,
  after a local-precedence ladder so a genuinely-local item of the same name stays local at any
  nesting depth. Composes with `.ending_with` / `.strict_prefix_only`; with the flag off the default
  is **byte-identical**, so existing constitutions and baselines are unaffected. Carried as a new
  `#[non_exhaustive]` rule variant (patch-safe; identity-parity, no baseline churn), and 圭表 grows
  its own rename-aware dependency-name reader — no dependency on 渾儀 (三儀 ⊥ 三儀), still `syn`-free.
  Stated bounds (an `extern crate … as` rename; and, under a single-segment prefix, a local binding
  or a definition site that reads as a call) are declared, never a silent pass.
- Adopter cookbook recipes (`COOKBOOK.md`): test that a boundary reacts, gate workspace coverage in
  CI, why exposure rules are deny-shaped (not a "may only expose" allowlist), and the
  `strict_external` recipe. `README.md` gains a "what the instruments do **not** see" note, so a
  reader does not over-infer a dimension's reach (渾儀 reads a signature's types/traits, never a
  call site).

### Changed
- Internal refinement, behavior-preserving and no public-API change: 渾儀's whole-crate-scan
  capabilities share one violation-emission helper; the text projection shares a module-block
  helper; idiom/consistency cleanups; and `xingbiao` now carries `#![deny(missing_docs)]` like its
  five sibling crates.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- 圭表 inline-symbol-path confinement — forbid a crate from *calling* a fully-qualified path inline
  (e.g. `std::time::SystemTime::now()`), resolving `use` renames / aliases / re-exports and the
  glob-danger shapes. The syn-free static complement to observing a `use`-import.
- 渾儀 `UnsafeBoundary` — declare that a crate's `unsafe` (blocks, `unsafe fn`/`impl`/`trait`,
  `unsafe extern`) may appear **only under** a declared subtree
  (`UnsafeBoundary::in_crate("app").only_under(["crate::ffi"])`): the auditability boundary of a
  layered crate, the confinement complement of `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- 渾儀 visibility ceiling — `max_visibility(Crate | Super | Module)`, generalizing the binary
  `must_not_declare_pub` into a rank ceiling (an item declared above the ceiling reacts; the prior
  rule is now the `max_visibility(Crate)` sugar, byte-stable in findings).
- 渾儀 async-exposure opt-in **subtree** scope — `.including_submodules()` descends the anchored
  module's whole subtree, so a "this seam is synchronous" boundary governs a pure kernel throughout,
  not only at its own seam.
- Every crate declares `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — the family is `unsafe`-free and says so at
  compile time.
- `examples/` gained `unsafe-confinement` and `sans-io-pure`, plus a `max_visibility` demo in
  `hunyi-standalone`.

### Fixed
- 渾儀 unsafe-confinement: the finding is owner-qualified (`unsafe impl {trait} for {self type}`), so
  two `unsafe impl`s of one trait for different self types in a module no longer collapse to one
  finding — closing a baseline-masking false negative.
- 渾儀 / 圭表: a nested `#[cfg_attr(pred, path = "…")]` module remap is recognized in both dimensions,
  closing a silent false negative in the static scanner and the semantic subtree walk.
- 圭表 type-alias resolution skips a defaulted generic parameter's `=`
  (`type Clock<Tz = LocalTz> = std::time::SystemTime;` now resolves to its real target), closing a
  false negative where a confined type reached through the alias passed unobserved.

### Changed
- modou is no longer framed as superseded. It is a living, independently-developed sibling project;
  Tianheng's static core (圭表) is *derived from* it, and Tianheng keeps all three dimensions
  (README / PROJECT).
- README gained a Phase-0 one-line on-ramp (lock one seam, enforce, pipe SARIF into CI) above the
  full multi-dimension example.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- 圭表 `confine_external_crate` — confine an **external** crate's `use` imports to one declared
  module subtree (FFI / platform-vocabulary confinement): `ModuleBoundary::in_crate("app")
  .module("crate::ffi").confine_external_crate("libc")` reacts when any module outside
  `crate::ffi`'s subtree imports `libc`. The first static rule to *observe* external-crate imports
  (every other rule ignores them), source-observed — not a `cargo metadata` dependency-table rule.
  The confined crate is the violation target, so confinements of different crates on one module stay
  distinct in the baseline. A package name written with a `-` (e.g. `windows-sys`) matches its
  underscore import identifier (`windows_sys`).
- `COOKBOOK.md` — a cookbook of common governance intents expressed as declared boundaries (圭表 /
  渾儀 / 漏刻 recipes), the imitable surface an adopter or agent copies rather than translating a
  foreign policy format.
- Coloured, reason-first terminal output for the human `check` report — a severity-coloured header
  (red for an enforced violation, yellow for an advisory) over the emphasised reason. Presentation
  only: gated to an interactive terminal (honours `NO_COLOR`), so a pipe, a redirect, or a CI log
  stays byte-identical, and `--format json` / `sarif` are never coloured.
- `examples/` — three runnable, self-checking examples: `guibiao-standalone` (the syn-free static
  import linter), `hunyi-standalone` (the semantic public-API exposure linter), and `composed`
  (the `tianheng` shell governing one app with all three instruments, in a CI-time `check` mode and
  a runtime `run` mode).
- Per-instrument GitHub issue templates (圭表 / 渾儀 / 漏刻).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- Extracted the `cargo metadata` substrate into a new `xingbiao` crate — a `serde_json`-only base
  beneath the dimensions — so the static and semantic dimensions read the workspace through one
  source of truth instead of two hand-copied twins.

### Fixed
- 渾儀 forbidden-marker: closed two false negatives — a hand `impl` whose self-type is spelled
  through a `pub use` re-export, and a locally-renamed (`use … as`) trait/derive leaf.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- 圭表 `must_only_be_imported_by` — the closed inbound dual of `must_not_be_imported_by`
  ("only `crate::facade` may import `crate::internal`").

### Fixed
- 漏刻 probe-coverage audit: a probe inside a `macro_rules!` body no longer counts as coverage.
- Recorded a documented robustness bound in the `use`/`mod` lexer around multibyte char literals
  (no confirmed false negative).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- 圭表 module-source hardening: module boundaries use Cargo's observed `src_path`, and
  `#[path]`-remapped and inline-only orphan modules are excluded rather than governed through a
  same-named conventional file.
- Packaging: every publishable crate now physically bundles its `LICENSE-MIT` / `LICENSE-APACHE`
  texts (`cargo publish` ships only crate-local files; 0.1.0–0.1.1 shipped without them). Guarded
  by a CI reaction.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- 渾儀 semantic depth: public re-export exposure and trait-impl exposure.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- 圭表 `restrict_dependency_sources_to` — govern the declared dependency source kind
  (git / registry / path).
- 渾儀 `dyn`-trait and `impl Trait` boundaries, and async-exposure.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Early packaging and metadata hygiene.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Initial release of the crate family: the `xuanji` reaction model, the three observation
  instruments — 圭表 (`guibiao`, static), 渾儀 (`hunyi`, semantic), 漏刻 (`louke`, runtime) — and
  the 天衡 (`tianheng`) shell that composes them into one `check` with a `0` / `1` / `2` exit
  contract and `--format json` / `sarif` projections.
