# Project Contract — 天衡 (Tianheng)

Tianheng's orientation layer for humans and AI agents. Keep it short and concrete.

## Purpose

Tianheng is a Rust-native **reactive architectural-governance** framework. It does not
run your app and it does not instruct your agent; developers and agents propose change,
and Tianheng uses compiler/CI and runtime **reactions** to keep
architectural shape from drifting. The source of truth is Rust code; TOML, Markdown, and
reports are projections of it.

It grows from **modou** (墨斗): modou proved the static dimension as a single focused crate,
and 圭表 is derived from it — but modou lives on as an independently-developed sibling project,
not a line Tianheng supersedes. Tianheng keeps that proven core and grows it into a **crate
family** of observation dimensions — without becoming a god crate.

## What Tianheng is — and is not

- It **is** reactive governance across **observation dimensions** (static, semantic, and
  runtime — all three 儀 built), each a separate crate the user selects by depending on it.
- It is **not active shaping**: it observes and reacts; it does not generate or prescribe
  structure. (Active shaping is a different axis, deliberately deferred — adopting it would
  be a conscious amendment, not drift.)
- It is **not a framework** in the prescriptive sense: you do not build *inside* it. It is
  a CLI + library.
- It is **not a lint**: every dimension must be real drift — declared intent vs. observed
  reality — never an opinionated style check.
- It is **not a supply-chain policy engine**: resolved, whole-graph dependency policy —
  advisories, dependency licenses, bans / duplicates, resolved source allowlists — is
  cargo-deny's lane (run in this repo's `supply-chain` CI job). Tianheng governs the
  *declared, per-target, architectural* layer instead (deps / imports by name, declared
  dependency-source kind for manifest hygiene, type exposure, impl locality, visibility,
  runtime seams). The two are complementary, not overlapping — the reason resolved
  build-provenance is cargo-deny's, not a Tianheng capability (see the 圭表 depth decision).

## Core Contract

A **declared boundary reacts.** A boundary declared in Rust must produce a real,
non-bypassable reaction when violated — for the CI dimensions, a CI failure with a non-zero exit and
an explanatory report. The reaction MUST never silently pass, and MUST distinguish a
boundary violation (exit 1) from a constitution error / misconfiguration (exit 2). The
one forbidden bug is a **false negative** (a real violation that silently passes).

## 潛移 (Qiányí) — govern by gravity, too: the idiom is imitated, the reaction is the backstop

The reaction binds, but an autoregressive agent is first an **imitation engine** — it
continues whatever idiom sits in its context. So compliance has a second source,
complementary to the non-bypassable reaction: **潛移 (qiányí) — gravity, the quiet pull of an
idiom** (潛移默化: it is assimilated without being told). The more the declared law and the
governed code read *as one strong, distinctive idiom in the agent's context*, the more its
continuations stay in-shape by default — and invocation stops being an act the agent must
remember and becomes an **emergent property of imitation**. This is neither instruction
(dictating what to write) nor bare reaction (catching it after); the agent is *pulled*, not
pushed or told — still consistent with "we do not instruct your agent."

Hence a standing design principle: **every Tianheng-facing semantic surface — the
declaration DSL, the `because`/`reason` prose, and the law's projections (`list --format
markdown` foremost) — is designed to be *imitated*, not merely *read* or *parsed*.**
Legibility serves a human; imitability serves the continuation engine, and the two optimize
differently — density, distinctiveness, and reason-as-first-class-prose over exhaustive
enumeration. But imitability is **bounded by the drift law**: an imitable surface states the
forward shape its boundary *observes and reacts to*, never structural guidance beyond that
perimeter. A reason that pulls the agent toward a shape Tianheng cannot react to is prose
prescription — the open loop this project exists to close, smuggled back in as text.

Gravity does **not** replace the reaction; it relocates it. Imitation transports *surface
form*, never *invariants* — a strong idiom still admits a locally-plausible violation. So
gravity lowers the base rate of drift (the frictionless primary) and the non-bypassable
reaction forecloses what gravity misses (the backstop). The one forbidden bug is still a
false negative, and only the reaction can foreclose it.

## Inherited laws (from modou — non-negotiable)

- **Drift law** — *No drift type without an observation source. No target type or name
  without a reaction.* Names are not claimed for reactions that do not yet exist; this
  holds at module, crate, and **dimension** granularity (we do not pre-create empty
  `semantic`/`runtime` crates).
- **Minimalism bound** — fail loud only on *observable misconfiguration*; no defensive
  over-foolproofing of impossible states.
- **SemVer honesty** — pre-1.0, a release that breaks no public API is a **patch**, never
  a vanity minor bump. (modou's hard-won lesson.)

## Architecture — a crate family, not a god crate

- **`xuanji` (璇璣) — the 底 (bedrock).** The dimension-agnostic **reaction model** the
  whole stack turns on: `Severity`, `BoundaryKind`, `Violation`, `Report`, `Baseline`,
  `Outcome`, with the JSON serialization intrinsic to those types. `serde_json`-only; carries no observation
  engine, and depends on no workspace member — every dimension sits above it.
- **`xingbiao` (星表) — the workspace-data substrate.** The star-table: the shared,
  `serde_json`-only reader of `cargo metadata` (`cargo_metadata` / `find_package` /
  `crate_root_file`), sitting below every dimension like 璇璣 and depending on no workspace
  member. It is *not* 璇璣 — it does IO (it spawns cargo) and observes — but a substrate beneath
  the dimensions, so the static and semantic dimensions read the workspace through **one** source
  of truth, not two hand-copied twins that drift apart (the v0.1.6 SSOT extraction — see Decisions).
- **`guibiao` (圭表) — the static observation core.** The gnomon: it reads the cast
  shadow — imports, dependencies, and inline symbol-path calls (the clock-free
  `must_not_call_inline` confinement). The dependency-light static engine, derived from
  modou: declare crate- and module-import boundaries, observe from `cargo metadata` (read
  through 星表) and source `use` / symbol scans, compare, react. Pure functional core — no shell. Depends on `xuanji`
  (the reaction model), `xingbiao` (the metadata substrate), and `serde_json` only; the
  report/constitution *assembly* (which folds in the static `Coverage`) lives here, not in the model.
- **`tianheng` (天衡) — the shell.** The celestial balance that weighs declared against
  observed: the imperative shell + facade — CLI (arg parsing, filesystem, stdout/stderr),
  the `run` reaction that composes every dimension into one, and the re-exported public
  surface. Depends on every dimension it composes (`guibiao` + `hunyi` + `louke`). It is also where
  cross-cutting **composed profiles** live (e.g. `sans_io_pure`, folding a 圭表 clock-free and a 渾儀
  synchronous-API boundary into one declaration) — a dimension never composes its sibling, only the
  shell does (三儀 ⊥ 三儀).

**Functional core ⊥ imperative shell, at crate granularity.** `guibiao` must not depend
on `tianheng`. This is the crate-level upgrade of modou's module-level `engine ⊥ runner`,
and Tianheng enforces it on itself (`crates/tianheng/tests/self_governance.rs`) — eating
its own dog food, now across crate boundaries.

**A dimension is a crate born when built** (drift law at crate granularity), and the user
selects governance by depending on the dimensions they want:
- **`hunyi` (渾儀)** — AST/semantic observation (`syn`). **Built (v0.1.0):**
  signature-coupling (a module's public API must not *expose* a forbidden type), plus
  trait-impl locality, visibility, and forbidden-marker boundaries; **(v0.1.2):** a
  type-shape/existential **depth stair** on the same `syn` source — dyn-trait and impl-trait
  exposure (each shape-only *and* named-operand-scoped) and async-fn exposure — the type-shape
  and existential complements of signature-coupling; **(v0.1.3):** two further same-source depth
  additions to that flagship exposure surface — **re-export exposure** (a named public `pub use`
  of a forbidden type is itself an exposure, default-on — an API-compatible but behavior-changing
  false-negative closure) and **trait-impl exposure** (the opt-in `.including_trait_impls()`
  depth, surfacing a trait impl's impl-site-authored positions); **(v0.1.8):** a **visibility
  ceiling** (`max_visibility(Crate|Super|Module)` — the binary `must_not_declare_pub` generalized to
  a rank), **`unsafe`-confinement** (`UnsafeBoundary::only_under([…])` — `unsafe` confined to a
  declared subtree, the non-compiler-expressible complement of `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`), and an
  opt-in **whole-subtree scope** for async-exposure (`including_submodules`) — all detailed in the
  Decisions section. The heavy `syn` dependency is quarantined here, never in the core.
- **`louke` (漏刻)** — runtime observation. **Built (v0.1.0):** origin-assertion (a
  declared seam's `only_origins` allowlist), in two faces — the prod probe
  (`assert_boundary!`, fail-closed, a structured event by default, panic opt-in) and the
  `audit_probe_coverage` CI face, composed into `tianheng check`. Ships into the production
  binary; hot path is std-only, depends on 璇璣 only — 星表 is an additive, `audit`-feature-gated
  exception that never reaches the production hot path (0.2.3). (Design gate resolved — see
  Decisions.)

**The observatory vocabulary (manifested in governance).** The three observation
dimensions — 圭表 (static), 渾儀 (semantic), 漏刻 (runtime) — are the **三儀** (the three
instruments): *what* Tianheng measures; each is a crate born when built, each adds a new
drift type. The governance & observability layer — 垂象 (the reaction surface), 實錄 (the
baseline), 校讎 (the amendment flow) — are the **三司** (the three offices): *how* a reaction
is surfaced, recorded, and amended (see `BACKLOG.md`). 儀 measures, 司 administers — the
三儀 add what is observed, the 三司 wrap the reaction. Both are crate-or-convention as their
nature dictates, never named before their reaction exists.

## Naming — narrative, with meaning in the SSOT

Crate and concept names are **coined / narrative** (圭表, 渾儀, 漏刻), in the celery/kombu
tradition: a name is a stable handle, not a self-description. Meaning lives in the
authoritative **metadata SSOT** (each crate's `description` + docs) — fitting for a tool
whose own thesis is "the source is the SSOT; names are projections." The brand `tianheng`
(天衡) and the bedrock `xuanji` (璇璣) split the one master instrument, 璿璣玉衡: 璣 → 璇璣,
the jade pivot every measurement aligns to; 衡 → 天衡, the balance that weighs declared
against observed. The brand is a star (玉衡, in the Dipper's handle), not an instrument — so
it sits cleanly above the 三儀 it wields, sharing no name with any of them.

潛移 (the gravity thesis above) deliberately breaks the celestial pattern: it names neither
an instrument (儀) nor an office (司) but a **mode of governance** — compliance by imitation —
so it is drawn from the idiom 潛移默化 (change that assimilates without the subject's
awareness), not from 璿璣玉衡. It is a handle for *how* the declared law spreads, parallel to
govern-by-reaction, never a thing the tool wields.

## Decisions

Record significant decisions here (the *why*; specs and code carry the *what*).

- **Reborn from modou as a crate family.** modou was taken as frozen/complete at its own
  `0.1.1` when Tianheng was reborn; Tianheng started fresh (clean git history, clean SemVer
  from `0.1.0`) rather than expanding modou's single crate into a god crate. The runtime
  dimension *must* be a separate crate (it ships into production and must stay light), so a
  family is the destiny — but members are born only when built. *(Amended 2026-07: modou is
  unfrozen and now develops independently in its own repo — a living sibling, not a superseded
  ancestor. Tianheng retains all three dimensions including the static 圭表, does not reroute
  static-only users to modou, and 圭表 stays derived-from-modou by lineage. How modou evolves —
  including whether it depends on `guibiao`/`tianheng` — is out of Tianheng's scope; the two do
  not share a workspace, so no shared-shell / born-when-built commitment is pulled forward.)*
- **The static core is `guibiao`, not `tianheng-core`.** Named by its stable identity
  (the gnomon, the static instrument, modou's derivative), not by a temporary role ("the
  whole core back when it was the only dimension").
- **Cross-crate visibility is the price of the split.** Items modou kept `pub(crate)`
  (baseline, coverage, projection, `check_and_cover`) are `pub` in `guibiao` because the
  shell consumes them across the crate boundary. This widens the engine's public API
  beyond modou's minimal `check` — acceptable, and refinable pre-1.0.
- **Baseline is a generated snapshot, not policy.** A baseline records accepted
  violations so a dirty project can adopt a boundary and gate only on *new* drift; it is
  a projection of the report, never the constitution.
- **Module imports are observed by scanning source `use` declarations**, not by parsing
  a full AST. A hand-rolled scanner keeps the 圭表 core dependency-light and macro-free;
  its partial coverage — bare path expressions and macro-generated imports are out of scope —
  is acceptable because the drift law only enforces what is observed. An unconditional, direct
  `#[path = "…"]` remap is **followed** to its target (0.2.2), matching 渾儀/漏刻, so all three
  observation dimensions agree on what rustc compiles; a `cfg_attr`-wrapped `path = "…"` stays a
  cfg-conditional exclusion from the conventional module graph (following it cfg-blind could read
  a file rustc does not compile in the active configuration), so it fails loud rather than
  governing a same-named orphan. Comments and
  string literals (normal, byte, and raw) are stripped so their text is never mistaken
  for a `use`. A module's identity is derived in three places — its file path, its `mod`
  declaration, and a `use` path that names it — and these MUST stay in lockstep, since a
  divergence both fails to govern a real module and silently hides its imports (a false
  negative, the one thing the core contract forbids). Two consequences stay token-level,
  not parser-level, to keep the hand-rolled scanner: a raw identifier is canonicalized
  (`mod r#type;` compiles to `type.rs`, so `r#type` and `type` are one module), and a
  `use` is attributed to the inline `mod { … }` that encloses it (so `self`/`super`
  resolve correctly); macro bodies are stripped before scanning for `mod` declarations
  too, not just `use`s, so the out-of-scope rule for macro-generated items is symmetric.
  Adopting a real parser (`syn`) would resolve all of this for free but would break the
  dependency-light core (the `serde_json`-only self-law); that is an amendment, not a
  silent trade. A boundary's governed *target* is file-based: an inline `mod name { … }`
  is reachable for import attribution but owns no file, so it cannot be a target — a
  boundary on one fails loud with a self-describing constitution error (exit 2), distinct
  from an unknown-module typo, never a silent pass. Governing inline modules as targets is
  a deliberate non-goal here; if ever wanted it is a separate amendment.
- **Module Resolution & Safety Key Disambiguation.** Keyed identity for *governance* (what to report a violation under) and keyed identity for *safety/resolution bookkeeping* (what counts as "the same thing open", or where a file's own children live) are separate keys. A fix must target the underlying shared model rather than a single reported instance (the 0.2.2 module resolution lesson).
- **圭表's source concern is the declared layer; the resolved layer is cargo-deny's.** Tianheng governs the declared per-target layer (manifest hygiene, declared imports); resolved whole-graph build-provenance belongs to `cargo-deny`.
- **`xuanji` is an internal refactor (reaction model), `serde_json`-only.** Holds dimension-agnostic types (`Violation`, `Report`, `Baseline`, `Outcome`) beneath all dimensions without observation engines.
- **`xingbiao` is the shared workspace-data substrate.** Cargo metadata reading logic is consolidated into `xingbiao` below the 三儀 to prevent twin-drift.
- **The semantic capability-admission test (the gate against lints).** A semantic capability is admissible in 渾儀 iff: (1) declarative-not-lint; (2) no essential gap on local-crate AST; (3) anchorable to a `syn`-resolvable element.
- **Name resolution is a 渾儀-internal shared layer (`hunyi::resolve`).** `guibiao` (syn-free scanner) and `hunyi` (`syn` AST) retain separate resolution engines to maintain the syn quarantine.
- **漏刻 (runtime) is identity-coherent.** Prod face (`assert_boundary!`) is std-light and fail-closed; CI face (`audit_probe_coverage`) is feature-gated behind `audit` (`xingbiao` dependency).
- **Violation identity is a structured observed fact, not presentation.** 璇璣 carries the vocabulary-neutral `FindingKey` envelope and compares identities by `(target, rule, finding_key)`. Diagnostic text and file paths stay out of baseline identity.
- **Rule construction is builder-owned; inspection stays open-ended.** Data-carrying `Rule`/`ModuleRule` variants are `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- **The composed adopter surface is compile-reacted.** `tianheng::prelude::*` is the entrypoint. `check_constitution(&Constitution, &Path) -> Outcome` unifies CLI and library testing evaluation.
