# Backlog

Forward-looking work, deliberately deferred. Promote an item to an OpenSpec change when
you pick it up. Every future reaction obeys the drift law:

> **No drift type without an observation source. No target type or name without a
> reaction.**

Nothing here is "designed" yet — reaction *phases* with their observation sources named,
not APIs. A new observation dimension is **a crate, born when it is built** (never a
pre-created empty stub); the heavy dependency it needs is quarantined to that crate so the
`guibiao` core stays `serde_json`-only.

## Reaction phases — the 三儀 (observation dimensions)

Ordered by readiness. All three instruments ship in v0.1.0 (圭表 static, 渾儀 semantic, 漏刻
runtime); the entire admitted 三儀 layer is now built. What remains below is the rejected set
per dimension and the 三司 governance/observability layer.

### 渾儀 (Húnyí) — the semantic dimension  · crate `hunyi`  · **BUILT (v0.1.0) — admitted layer complete**
Observation source: the **AST** (`syn`). Sees what the `圭表` `use`-scan cannot — semantics
in the syntax tree: `pub` signatures, `impl Trait for Type`, attributes/derives, visibility.
The observation-source fork is **resolved**: `syn` was chosen (stable; its syntactic partial
coverage — glob / cross-crate re-export / macro / inference blindness, while local `pub use`
chains, incl. multi-hop and aliased, *are* followed — is *stated*, never silently passed),
over `cargo rustdoc --output-format json` (nightly + unstable format).

- **Public-API type leakage — signature-coupling** (flagship): **BUILT.** "A module's public
  API must not *expose* a forbidden type" — depending on a type internally is fine; leaking
  it across the public surface is the violation. The semantic companion to the dependency
  boundary.

Admitted **and now built** (each born when built, each passed the capability-admission test
in `PROJECT.md` — declarative, no *essential* gap, anchorable):
- **Type-anchor / local trait-impl surface**: **BUILT** (`TraitImplBoundary`,
  `.only_implemented_in(...)`) — "only `crate::commands::*` may `impl Command`"; the impl-site
  is a `syn`-resolvable local element, the second 渾儀 anchor type.
- **Forbidden-marker / attribute / visibility boundaries**: **BUILT** (`ForbiddenMarkerBoundary`,
  `VisibilityBoundary` `.must_not_declare_pub()`) — "`internal` exposes no `pub`".

The admitted 渾儀 layer is complete; what remains for this dimension is only the rejected set.

Explicitly **rejected** (essential gap — would be a false-negative engine, see `PROJECT.md`):
`Send`/`Sync` constraints (inferred auto-traits), external trait sealing (downstream crates),
transitive effect-purity ("no I/O anywhere reachable").

### 漏刻 (Lòukè) — the runtime dimension  · crate `louke`  · **BUILT (v0.1.0) — admitted layer complete**
Observation source: **runtime `TypeId` / object origin** at architectural seams. Sees what
static analysis structurally cannot — the concrete type behind a `dyn Trait`. **Built:** the
**origin-assertion** capability — `RuntimeBoundary::at("seam").only_origins([...])` declared
and installed at startup; a type opts into an *observed* origin via `register_origin!(Type)`
(captures `module_path!()`); a probe `assert_boundary!("seam", obj)` reads the live object's
concrete origin (via a `louke::Tracked` supertrait) and reacts **fail-closed** (unknown
origin reacts). Default reaction emits a `Violation` event; `panic` is opt-in. Plus the **CI
face** `audit_probe_coverage` — a source scan that every declared seam has a probe (closing
the "declared but never enforced" essential gap). 漏刻 reuses 璇璣's `Violation` as the
*measure* (xuanji gained `BoundaryKind::Runtime`), projecting it as a runtime **event** (the
CI dimensions project the same measure as an exit code). Hot path std-only + fold-hasher,
write-once registry, no lock; `serde_json` cold-path only via 璇璣. Identity resolved in the
PROJECT.md decision "漏刻 is identity-coherent"; overhead cleared by a spike (~4 ns).

- **Composed into `tianheng check`** (done): the shell now runs `audit_probe_coverage`
  alongside the static/semantic gates against the unified `Constitution` — `run(&constitution,
  args)` projects all 三儀 into one exit code. `audit_probe_coverage` takes the **declared
  `RuntimeBoundary` objects** (authoritative) and scans each member's `cargo metadata` source
  root for probes; the shell now depends on `louke` (self-governance allowlist amended). The
  prod face stays a function the adopter wires into their binary
  (`louke::install(constitution().runtime_boundaries()…)`).

Deferred / forward:
- **Rejected** (an explicit non-goal): runtime capability/effect drift ("no I/O reachable")
  — a runtime policy engine. The registry holds static label allowlists only, never predicates.

## Deferred — not a reaction phase (the 三司: governance & observability layer)

These are **not new drift types**; they wrap the reaction (how it is surfaced, recorded,
amended). Most are already built in v0.1.0 or are convention by design — listed so the map
survives across sessions.

- **垂象 (Chuíxiàng) — the reaction surface.** *Built:* text report, exit codes `0/1/2`,
  `--format json`. *Deferred surface expansions* (same observation, same constitution — not
  new drift): CI annotations (GitHub `::error::` / SARIF) so violations land inline in a PR
  diff; and an **editor/LSP shift-left** so an illegal `use` is red-lined as typed (a large
  integration; the LSP server could be its own crate, born when built).
- **實錄 (Shílù) — baseline & history.** *Built:* the snapshot gate (record accepted
  violations, fail only on *new* drift). *Deferred:* a **debt-ratchet**
  (`--require-baseline-reduction`, only-fix-never-add) — **in tension** with "baseline is a
  snapshot, not policy" and "not a governance platform". A bounded opt-in flag may fit; a
  debt-scheduling system does not. Resolve the tension before building.
- **校讎 (Jiàochóu) — the amendment flow.** Deliberately **not a tool feature**: the tool
  cannot tell shape-drift from policy-drift (not an observable fact), and must not own PR /
  merge orchestration. Realized as **harness convention** — `.github/CODEOWNERS` + steward
  review + the OpenSpec lifecycle + `AGENTS.md`. Already in place; nothing to build.

## Explicitly not on the roadmap

Active code-shaping / generation; a prescriptive framework you build inside; a **lint**
(built-in opinion rather than declared intent); a **universal graph API** (whole-graph
analysis rather than declared per-target boundaries); a **runtime policy engine**. Each
dimension keeps its own observation source; nothing is named before its reaction exists.
