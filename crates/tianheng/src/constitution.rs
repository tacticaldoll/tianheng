//! The constitution — the governed shape, declared in Rust (the single source of

//! `.github/CODEOWNERS` routes any change here to the steward (an amendment), so an
//! agent cannot silently weaken a boundary to make CI pass. See `AGENTS.md`.
//!
//! This sample drives the in-repo fixtures; a real project declares its own.
